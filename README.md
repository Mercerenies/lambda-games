Fun little PureScript library that computes free theorems for a given
Haskell type, per [Theorems for
free!](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/831/burton/Notes/July14/free.pdf).

I mainly wrote this in order to learn PureScript.

Run with `npx spago run`. Enter a Haskell type annotation (with no
free variables) and the free theorem will print out.
